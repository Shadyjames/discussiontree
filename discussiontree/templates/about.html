<h2>About discussiontree</h2>
<p>
Discussiontree is a new way of bringing order to discussions and debates that have a tendency to become disorderly and uncivil.
Instead of exchanging statements back and forth as per conventional communication (verbal conversation, text chat, email, forum posts etc), discussiontree provides a <i>communal data structure</i>, that can be tended by a number of people simultaneously, with strict constraints surrounding structure, authorship and anonymity which all work together to create an environment where calm rational debate can take place.<br/>
<br/>
Discussiontree was developed with the objective of overcoming AT LEAST the following shortcomings of conventional communication:<br/>
<b>Reputation</b> - Social hierarchy is an unavoidable fact of any community with persistent identities. People will often withold debate on topics they think might make them unpopular, or rush to support opinions that are a part of the zeitgeist. Furthermore, readers of content created by entities already known by reputation are likely to form a bias based on their opinion of the author. People might also be unwilling to rebut a fallacious argument if it supports their beliefs due to the importance of their beliefs being "right" in the eyes of others. By being completely anonymous, Discussiontree avoids the myriad detrimental effects that reputation concerns have on open discussion.<br/>
<b>Evasion</b> - Dodging questions, and refusing to address pertinent holes in ones argument as though they did not exist are commonplace in real world debates and discussions. However, nodes on the discussiontree cannot be silenced except by refutation. It is simply not an option to starve them of airtime or push them off-screen with a flood of new text. Any point that is not addressed simply sits uncontested, forevermore a middle finger raised in defiance of your argument. And the longer it sits unrefuted, the more credibility it gradually gains<br/>
<b>Ad hominem</b> - Because node authorship is anonymous to everybody but the author themselves, inflammatory or adversarial statements are more or less nonsensical. "Spam", like in any other forum, may require moderation. But for legitimate hot-tempered users, there will not be an identity at which to channel their hatred.<br/>
<b>State</b> - For a new participant to weigh in on a long-running discussion, they will usually first need to bring themselves up to date on the state of the conversation thus far. That might include a lot of garbage text which has already been successfully refuted. In discussiontree, nodes are presented in order of credibility, meaning that all the most relevant and hotly-contested information is presented straight away, and nodes with a very low credibility are only visible when you go looking for them.<br/>
<b>Citation needed</b> - Citations can be attached to evidence or refutation nodes, allowing research efforts to persist and help future participants in the conversation educate themselves about the topic, rather than having to come up with throwaway citations for statements that may have been made and supported by a hundred different people in a hundred different discussions.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, by the time it is feature complete, it will have many more advantages:<br/>
<b>Structure</b> - The structure of the discussiontree innately prohibits certain forms of irrationality. For example, the only thing that can be attached to a Proposition node is an Evidence node. There is no such thing as a "You can't prove it's NOT true" node, and if you attempt to include that as an evidence node, it can be refuted in a heartbeat using the "Appeal to ignorance" fallacy template.<br/>
<b>Templates</b> - There are lots of fallacious frequently-recurring arguments. These can be refuted with minimal time investment, by using refutation templates. Also, using templates does not lend white noise the legitimacy that a hand-typed response would, discouraging further irrationality.<br/>

<h3>Quantifying credibility</h3>
<p>
The ultimate goal of the discussiontree is to be able to quantify the credibility of both every point in an argument, as well as every participant. The exact algorithm for calculating credibility is still in the prototyping stages, but the idea is that users will be able to add credibility to a node by marking it as "sound". To mark a node as "Sound" means that you have read and understood the statements made therein and are willing to stake a little bit of your own Credibility score that the node cannot be successfully refuted. When you do this, your credibility and the credibility of that node become inextricably linked. If multiple highly-credible refutations are lodged, your credibility will fall. If the node stands for a long time and is not met with any refutations, or only refutations of low credibility, your credibility score will rise.<br/>
<br/>
Credibility is also fundamentally very different from an "upvote". Where an "upvote" is a static count of the number of people who approve of a comment, credibility differs in a number of important respects:<br/>
<b>It is only TIME that may increase a nodes credibility</b> - A node will always start with a credibility of 0, even if the entire population of the earth clicked "Mark as Sound" the moment the node was created. Until time passes, the refutability of the node hasn't been tested.<br/>
<b>Credibility is constantly recalculated</b> - When you mark a node as Sound, you stake your credibility on it, forever, and it cannot be retracted. Likewise, a nodes credibility is forever tied to the credibility of those who have marked it Sound, and the credibility of those who have marked its refutations Sound.<br/>
<b>Ideally, arguing both sides of the same argument will enhance your credibility</b> - We want to encourage a steadfast dedication to the truth, not a steadfast dedication to ones agenda. So arguing against something you believe, on the grounds of stamping out fallacy, is a worthy thing that should be rewarded.<br/>
<b>Self-moderating</b> - If somebody consistently adds low-quality, inflammatory or irrational content to the site, their credibility will fall low enough that their contributions will be almost invisible on the default view of the tree. Without any need for bans or moderation, the community can be partially self-policing in a way that cannot be abused, because the "policing" is no different from normal usage of the site, and users can't be targeted because node authorship is anonymous<br/>
